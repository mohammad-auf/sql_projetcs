SQL is an essential tool for data analysts to handle and store structured data in databases. We build two different projects that will provide hands-on experience to apply these skills in real-life scenarios.We learn SQL from YouTube and other free online resources available.

Projects are :-

2) Awesome_Chocolatea_Analysis
